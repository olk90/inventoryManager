# inventoryManager

This application will help to keep track of items that are currently
on loan. It might be relevant for sports clubs, etc. whenever there
are objects on loan to members for a certain period of time.

The whole "database" will be stored in a JSON file. On start up the
information are stored in the correct views and can be edited as
necessary.

## Attention

The app is still under development. A brief manual will be added as
soon, as there will be a first release.
